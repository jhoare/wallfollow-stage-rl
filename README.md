WallFollow Stage RL
===================

This is example code for learning a wall-following controller for a differential
drive robot using Sarsa Reinforcement Learning.

This was a coursework assignment for a machine learning class I took in
Grad-School (University of Tennessee)

See the PDF files for details (both the given problem statement and my final
report that accomponied my code).

TODO: This does not currently work with the latest version of stage. (stage4)
